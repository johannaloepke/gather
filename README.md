# gather

You've been invited to a potluck. Sounds fun! But wait... what to bring?? Are there dietary restrictions / allergies to be aware of? How much food should you make? Is somebody else also bringing a kale salad? 

Gather helps ease these anxieties by providing a simple, no login required, interface that allows hosts to request items at their event and guests to share what they're bringing. 

Gather. For better get togethers!
